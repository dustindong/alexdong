          <p>Gordon Joly began his tai chi journey in 1990 and has been teaching since 1997. Since then he has taught at the BBC Club (at BBC Television Centre) and Madame Tussauds in London (UK) and at many classes around London. He has held weekend workshops in the UK and Canada. His interest in tai chi started from a training in dance and some exploration of yoga. He likes the special type of meditation brought through practice of the tai chi Slow Set.</p>

          <p>Gordon first met Master Alex Dong in the early 1990s and has followed the family style ever since. He sees the art as being accessible to all, and hence this allows both the energetic youngster, and the more careful older student to follow and gain benefit. He is interested in writing about tai chi, from all perspectives; he sees a relationship between some parts of mathematics and tai chi as well as between music and tai chi.</p>

          <img src="../../assets/images/instructor/arthur.jpg">
        <p>I started studying tai chi in 1991 with the student, of the student of
        my teacher's father: Dong Zhen Chen. I became a more serious student
        in 1998 after I joined Master Alex's father's trip to China: The skill
        and accuracy of their students from other countries blew me away and
        gave me a goal.</p>

        <p>From 1998 I tried a lot harder and attended many of Master Alex Dong's
        workshops around the world. My teaching philosophy is to try and
        plagiarize as much as I can from Master Alex's classes. Part of the
        fun of being taught by Master Alex is, that feeling you get when he
        suddenly makes simple, things that were making your head hurt trying
        to understand.</p>

        <p>I like tai chi because it's mentally and physically stimulating, and
        makes you feel great. I live in Essex.</p>

           <p>I started martial arts in 1990 in a school named Ying Wu Kwan Kung Fu, where I achieved 3 grades and I also did judo as a child.</p>
            <p>When I moved from one address to another in Dagenham I changed doctors that was where I met Phillip Shields.
               I had one lesson of tai chi and felt fantastic and followed Phillip to all his other classes for seven years mainly learning slow set and push hands. Phillip was a great teacher of tai chi and when I met Alex Dong for the first time I could see where his teaching method had come from.
            <p>I attended classes with Alex in the UK, and the energy and well being was great. I wouldn't say its a cure but it does help dilute physical and mental problems.
            <p>I like tai chi because it is beneficial to my health and it makes me feel good as long as I keep training. </p>

                        <h3>Alan Finch</h3>
                      <p>
                       I always had an interest in martial arts mainly after going to the
                       cinema to see Bruce Lee films.</br>

                       In 1989 I started to attend a Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan short form
                       course run by the London Borough of Redbridge. To progress I then went
                       to classes in London.</br>

                       In the 1990s I started being taught with Master Alex Dong and
                       immediately I was hooked by his style and way of teaching.</br>

                       The years have passed but since then I have learnt many new forms, met
                       many friends who, like myself, are very enthusiastic about Tai Chi.</br>

                       Alex teaches new forms but also devotes a lot of his time on
                       refinements of existing forms pointing out slight modifications and
                       nuances in order to create a better, more flowing form. I find this is
                       an enjoyable part of Tai Chi as it means the form evolves over time
                       and the changes are logical when explained.</br>

                       I have had my Instructors Certificate with the Tai Chi Union for Great
                       Britain since 2002 and have assisted the weekly seniors group together
                       with taking classes when instructors are on holiday. In May 2017 I
                       took voluntary redundancy from my regular employment and now take
                       classes in London and Essex having been accepted by Alex Dong as one
                       of his instructors.</br>

                       One of the classes I teach is provided by the Redbridge Carers Support
                       Service for people who are carers for a disabled, frail or elderly
                       relative or friend.  This assists in reducing their stress levels,
                       providing a calming effect and inner peace and these students have
                       said they have benefitted from improved mobility and strength.</br>

                       The other class I teach is in Blackheath, London which is during the
                       lunchtime period.</br>

                       My other pasttimes are Iyengar Yoga which I have been practicing
                       since I was 20 plus playing Table Tennis in various local leagues.</p>
