        <h3>Westwater Intensive Training 2015</h3>

        <p>Friday April 24th to Saturday May 2nd 2015</p>

        <p>Highlights will be to reteach the Fajin form and work on Fajin energy, Push Hands and weapons. More details to follow.</p>

        <p>West Water camp is located on the beautiful high desert of the Utah - Colorado border, forty five minutes from the Grand Junction, Colorado Walker Field airport and five hours from Denver and Salt Lake City. It's warm during the day and cool at night. At 5000 feet in elevation, the stars and moon are more beautiful and bright. Miles away from civilization, for nearly a decade students from around the world have found the solitude, and nature of the area, a powerful adjunct to their study of Taj Ji.</p>

        <p>This camp has no indoor sleeping arrangements; everyone has to bring their own tent and bedding for camping, and personal things like towel, soap, shampoo, sun block, hat and flip flops. Keep in mind late night temperature could drop down to freezing. Meals, showers, washing machine and two flushing toilets along with dining and training halls are provided.</p>
